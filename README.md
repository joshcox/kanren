# Introduction
Kanren is a port of [`microKanren`](https://github.com/jasonhemann/microKanren) to TypeScript. I'll defer to [miniKanren.org](http://minikanren.org/) for an explanation of what types of problems the `kanren` family of languages solve.

The initial goal with this particular port is to provide an API that can easily be extended to include additional term types and constraints.

# Getting Started
First things first, install `kanren`: `npm install --save kanren`

Import `kanren`.
```typescript
// es6
import { kanren }  from "kanren";

// commonjs
const { kanren } = require("kanren");

const { unify, callWithFresh, disj, conj, runAll } = kanren();
```

Real quick aside - `kanren` operates over `Term`s. No other values are supported within `kanren`. Note that `symbol` `Term`s are reserved for internal use within `kanren`; please don't use them.
```typescript
type Term = boolean | undefined | null | number | string | symbol | Array<any>;
```

Anyway... Now that we have `kanren`, use `runAll` to determine if `1` unifies with `1`.

```typescript
> runAll( unify(1, 1) ).size
1
```

As you can see, there's one state in which the `unify(1, 1)` goal succeeds. So yes, `1` unifies with `1`.
Does `1` unify with `2`?

```typescript
> runAll( unify(1, 2) ).size
0
```

It sure doesn't. There are `0` states in which the `unify(1, 2)` goal succeeds. What happens when we `unify` other `Term`s?

```typescript
> runAll( unify([1], 1) ).size
0
> runAll( unify([1], [1]) ).size
1
> runAll( unify([1], [1,2]) ).size
0
> runAll( unify(true, true) ).size
1
> runAll( unify(true, false) ).size
0
> runAll( unify(false, false) ).size
1
```

So, in general, `Term`s with equivalent structures and values tend to unify. What about wildcards? The `callWithFresh` goal wraps a goals and introduces a variable that can be used within the internal goal.

```typescript
> // Wrap a goal with a hole (`unify(_,5)`) with a function of one argument.
> // Use the single parameter to fill in the hole
> const goalWithVariable = (joker) => unify(joker, 5);
> // Pass `goalWithVariable` to `callWithFresh` to create a goal that creates a logic variable
> runAll( callWithFresh(goalWithVariable) ).size
1
> runAll( callWithFresh((joker) => unify(joker, 5)) ).get(0).substitution.get(0)
{ left: Symbol(0), right: 5 }
> runAll( callWithFresh((joker) => unify(5, joker)) ).get(0).substitution.get(0)
{ left: Symbol(0), right: 5 }
```

We've just created what's known as a logic variable. Like normal variables in the javascript world, this can be used to represent values. As you can see within the subsitution above, you can assign a logic variable by unifying it with another term. You can also assign logic variables to values within non-primitive terms, such as `Array`s.

```typescript
> runAll( callWithFresh((a) => unify([a], [5])) ).get(0).substitution.get(0)
{ left: Symbol(0), right: 5 }
```

You might want to make multiple calls to `unify`. Using `conj` (conjunction a.k.a logical "and") we can create an aggregate goal that encompasses two smaller goals. Both goals must succeed for the aggregate to succeed.

```typescript
> runAll( conj(unify(1,1), unify(1,1)) ).size
1
> runAll( conj(unify(1,1), unify(1,2)) ).size
0
> runAll( conj(unify(1,2), unify(1,2)) ).size
0
> runAll( callWithFresh((a) => conj(unify(a,5), unify([a],[5]))) ).size
1
> runAll( callWithFresh((a) => conj(unify(a,5), unify(a,[]))) ).size
0
```

Like `conj`, you could also use `disj` (disjunction a.k.a logical "or") to create an aggregate goal that encompasses two smaller goals. Unlike `conj`, only one of `disj`'s sub-goal need succeed for the aggregate to succeed.

```typescript
> runAll( disj(unify(1,1), unify(1,1)) ).size
2
> runAll( disj(unify(1,1), unify(1,2)) ).size
1
> runAll( disj(unify(1,2), unify(1,2)) ).size
0
> runAll( callWithFresh((a) => disj(unify(a,5), unify(a,6))) ).size
2
> runAll( callWithFresh((a) => disj(unify(a,5), unify([a],[]))) ).size
1
```

Note that `disj` has the power to create new states; it creates a branch. `conj` is used to compound new information to existing states.
